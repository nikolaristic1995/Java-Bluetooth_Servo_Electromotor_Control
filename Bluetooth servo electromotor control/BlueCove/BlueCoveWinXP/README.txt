Blue Cove
---------

Blue Cove is an open source implementation of the JSR-82 Bluetooth API for Java, targetted at desktop (J2SE) platforms.

At present only a subset of the API is implemented. 

We current support the Microsoft Bluetooth stack for Windows XP Service Pack 2. For instructions on how to install this stack prior to the release of Service Pack 2, see

http://eben.phlegethon.org/bluetooth.html

To get started, place intelbth.dll in your library path, and BlueCove.jar in your classpath. You will then be able to compile and run the following test applications.

ServerTest
----------

Creates and advertises a Bluetooth service with a specified name. When a device connects to this service, reads a UTF-8 string, prints it on the screen, and terminates.

ClientTest
----------

Connects to every nearby instance of ServerTest, and writes a specified UTF-8 string to each.
